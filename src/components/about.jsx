            <h1>Whatâ€™s This App About?</h1>

            <p>This project is all about learning <b>CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)</b> using <b>Firebase</b> and <b>React.js.</b> Instead of setting up a traditional backend, Firebase handles everything â€“ from storing data to managing updates in real time.  

ğŸš€           <h4>Tech Behind This App:</h4> 
ğŸ”¹<b> React.js</b>â€“ To build a smooth and interactive UI  
ğŸ”¹<b>Firebase Functions</b> â€“ For handling backend tasks  
ğŸ”¹<b>Cloud Firestore</b>â€“ Where the data is stored  
ğŸ”¹<b>React Router </b>â€“ To navigate between pages  

I built this as part of an assignment to get hands-on experience with Firebase and explore how easy it is to manage data without a dedicated backend.  

Hope you like it! Give it a try and see Firebase in action. ğŸš€</p>
